# Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the process of deploying a React application from GitHub to an AWS environment using various AWS services. The workflow includes source control, orchestration, building, testing, monitoring, and hosting.

## Tools and Services
- **GitHub**: Source control for the React application.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates the deployment workflow.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Handles building and testing of the application.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors logs and metrics for CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
- **AWS S3**: Serves as the destination for storing files and hosting the application.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Source Stage (GitHub)
- The process begins with the React application code stored in a GitHub repository.
- Changes or updates pushed to the repository trigger the deployment pipeline.

### 2. Orchestration (AWS CodePipeline)
- AWS CodePipeline is configured to detect changes in the GitHub repository.
- It orchestrates the flow by passing the code to the next stages: build and test.

### 3. Build and Test (AWS CodeBuild)
- AWS CodeBuild compiles the React application code.
- It runs tests to ensure the application is functioning as expected.
- Successful builds are prepared for deployment.

### 4. Monitoring (AWS CloudWatch)
- AWS CloudWatch logs and monitors the activities of both CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
- Metrics and logs are used to troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth operation.

### 5. Deployment (AWS S3)
- The built application files are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.
- The S3 bucket is configured for static website hosting to serve the React application.

## Flow Summary
- **GitHub → AWS CodePipeline → AWS CodeBuild → AWS S3**
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch tracks CodePipeline and CodeBuild throughout the process.

## Notes
- Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are configured for each AWS service.
- Regularly review CloudWatch logs for any deployment issues.
